\section{User Involvement Methods}
In order to find out more about our future users, we decided to design a questionnaire and to do a contextual inquiry. 

\subsection{Questionnaire}
Questionnaires are simple to administer and an easy way to get to know about the general attitude people have about buying clothes online, baby clothes in particular. Since we are building a web shop, our target group has access to a computer and an email account, so we designed our questionnaire in a way that it can be sent out by email. Our questions aim at finding out more about our users, their online shopping behavior as well as their previous experiences with web shops. 

We conducted our study in two phases. First, we designed a draft to do a pilot study to get some feedback from users. Then, we improved our questionnaire according to this feedback and did the actual study with the final version of the questionnaire. To explain what the questionnaire is all about, we wrote an accompanying email, which can be found in the appendix section ~\ref{sec:letter}

\subsubsection{First Draft}
The questionnaire starts with an explanatory section on how to answer the multiple-choice questions, followed by some personal information inquiries, questions about web shops, online clothes stores in general and baby clothes stores in particular. It ends with a disclaimer on the usage of the questionnaire.

The \textit{personal information} questions aim at finding out more about the person filling out the questionnaire. With these questions, we hope to find out which user group the person belongs to and get some insight of whether the person is a parent or not. The \textit{web shops in general} section tries to find out more about the person's online shopping behavior. Especially, we would like to know if people mind to create an account when ordering items online, if wishlists are a feature that is actually used and what other features are valued most by users.
We also ask some more specific questions concerning clothes web shops to find out what the problems are when buying clothes online so that we can enhance our shop with features to make it easier to buy clothes online. 
Last, we have a few questions about \textit{baby clothes shops} in particular. We would like to include the feature that people can buy and sell used clothes online and we would like to know if users consider this useful. Also, we aren't sure how much help people need when deciding on the right size for baby clothes, so we have another question concerning selecting the correct size.

The first draft was designed by three members of our group.

\subsubsection{Pilot study}
In order to test the questionnaire, we handed it out to the forth member of our group to see what he thinks about it, being a computing science student and having attended the Human Computer Interaction Course as well. He also gave the questionnaire to .. (TODO) other people.

After the pilot tests, the questionnaire was updated with some improvements our team mate suggested. Also, some mistakes were corrected. In the introduction part, we added a simple question for the example in addition to the response. For the questions 3 and 12.a, instead of repeating the previous question, we just wrote "if yes", which is clearer. The fourth question was entirely rewritten because some people didn't understand the "computing expertise" term. In questions 6 and 10, "store" was replaced "shop" to keep the terminology consistent. The last update was the inversion (question 11) of the scale of values, from 1 = "not useful" to 5 = "very useful", because this seems to be more natural to people.

\subsubsection{Results}
We sent out .. questionnaires and got ... responses.
