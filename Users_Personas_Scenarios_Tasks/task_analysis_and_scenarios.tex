\section{Task analysis and scenarios}
\subsection{Hierarchical tasks model}

\subsection{Scenarios}
\textbf{Jeff and Judy Seavers} would like to surprise their daughter with a complete set of baby clothes.
Because Julie just had a girl, they would like to buy primarily pink or red clothes. Cost isn't that important, since the clothes will be a present for their daughter.
They would like to get the ordered clothes before their daughter leaves the hospital in about four days.%, so they need to be able to learn how to navigate through the online shop as quickly as possible and sort the products by availability.

\textbf{Sarah Gordon} still has most of the baby clothes from her first child. She only needs a new romper suit.
Due to the fact that she does not have much money, the romper suit should be as cheap as possible.
However, she wants her child to look cute, so she would like to find a suit with a hood and attached ears.

\textbf{Bruce Walker} is on the lookout for some nice baby clothes to give to his niece for her third birthday.
He doesn't really know what he wants but he always thinks that babies in yellow clothes look particularly cute, so he would like to buy yellow clothes.
Because his sister's baby will have her first birthday in about 2 weeks, he needs to have the clothes until then.

%\textbf{Greg Campbell} would really like to buy a suit for Lisa's son. But after a couple of talks with Lisa, he realised that a shirt and some pants would be better suited.
%He likes prints on his shirts, so he would like to find a shirt with the words "Rock Star" printed on it.
%Finding a nice shirt is more important to him than the price, but he wishes not to spend more than \pounds20 at the moment, including delivery.
